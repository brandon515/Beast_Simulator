This document specifies the functions and goals of the process manager class

Class Goals:
    To give CPU time to any process that needs it
    
Function:
    AttachProcess(ProcessPtr, ProcType):
        Make sure ProcessPtr is not null
        Get iterator from ProcessMap
        If iterator equals map::end
            Make new ProcessList = pcl
            add ProcessPtr to pcl
            
            

Variables:
    boost::shared_ptr<Process> ProcessPtr
    std::vector<ProcessPtr> ProcessList
    std::map<uint32_t, ProcessList> ProcessMap

Misc Notes:
    ProcType is a uint32_t that is the hash value of a string given by the CRC32 algorithm
